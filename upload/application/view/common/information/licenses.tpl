          <p>We currently support the following options:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Regular (Royalty Free) License</li>
              <li>Exclusive License</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Regular License</h2>
          <p>This license provides for multiple sales of the same item. Products covered by this licence are usually sold in high volumes at a lower price.</p>
          <p>Sellers can however set any price they consider reasonable and act in accordance with their business plan.</p>

          <h2 class="text-warning">Exclusive License</h2>
          <p>An Exclusive License covers items that will only be sold once after which the product is removed from sale and the seller agrees not to publish the product again.</p>
          <p>Products with an Exclusive License have relatively higher prices as the product will only be sold once and not multiple times.</p>
